# Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe game written in Bash. Download and execute `ttt.sh` to play. Tested in Ubuntu 18 and macOS Catalina (10.15).

```
chmod +x ttt.sh
./ttt.sh
```

The game creates a board.txt file in the directory it was executed in to keep track of the board. Currently, the "opponent" (computer) picks a random empty spot. Future plan will include making an algorithm that actually tries to tie or win the game.
